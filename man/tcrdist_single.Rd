\value{
Numeric value representing the tcrdist distance between the two TCRs.
Lower values indicate more similar TCRs.
}
\description{
Calculates the tcrdist distance between two T-cell receptors using BLOSUM62
amino acid substitution scoring and Needleman-Wunsch alignment. This is a
convenience function for comparing just two TCRs.
}
\details{
This function uses the same algorithm as \code{\link{calculate_tcrdist}} but
is optimized for comparing a single pair of TCRs. The distance calculation
combines distances from CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 regions of both alpha and beta
chains, with CDR3 weighted 3x more heavily than CDR1/2.

See \code{\link{calculate_tcrdist}} for detailed information about the
tcrdist algorithm and distance interpretation.

\itemize{
\item \strong{0}: Identical TCRs
\item \strong{< 50}: Very similar, likely same epitope specificity
\item \strong{50-100}: Moderate similarity
\item \strong{> 100}: Dissimilar TCRs
}
